## The problem
We've realized every hotels' biggest problem right now is the COVID-19 outbreak.
Traveling has been banned, borders have been closed.
People are canceling their trips abroad and staying at home.
Hotels are not getting any revenue, but they still have bills to pay.
Where does the money come from, with closed doors?

## The solution
https://staysafe.valpashotels.net/
Travelers should not cancel their trips entirely but postpone them.
The responsible thing to do is to support the hoteliers during these tough times.
Currently, the industry-standard method for buying gift cards to hotels is by email.
Some travelers are aware of this, but for many of them, it is not obvious.
Hoteliers have not had an easy method of setting up online gift card stores, especially now with a minimal budget.
We're solving all of these issues to bring hoteliers more gift cards while giving travelers extra benefits for their future stays.

## What we are doing
We are a digital marketing campaign to raise awareness of the issue.
We make it easy for travelers to buy a gift card to their favorite hotel.
We make it effortless for hotels to issue and redeem gift cards.

### The campaign in three steps for the travelers:
1. Be responsible, stay at home now.
2. Be helpful, buy a gift card to help the hoteliers in need.
3. Be free, travel when the time is right.

### The campaign in three steps for the hoteliers:
1. Let us know about your hotel and the gift cards you'd like to sell
2. We'll build a custom page of your hotel on our campaign site (ie. https://staysafe.valpashotels.net/hotel/hotel-f6)
3. We will implement an online gift card store, that travelers can use to support you

## The technologies
We built a website that informs travelers about the issue and lets them help hoteliers by buying gift cards.
It's built with all the latest cool web technologies to ensure a quick and effortless experience: next.js, stripe.
The website has an embedded gift card store powered by GiftUp.
We're using Airtable as CMS to effortlessly add new hotels once they sign up.
